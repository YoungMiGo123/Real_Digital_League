# Real_Digital_League

The project is super simple to Run. Simply install visual studio 2017 > 
You will need .Net Core 3 > installed inorder for it to run.
The assessment code is done in the Index.cs & Index.cshtml. 
Once visual studio has been installed simply click on the *.sln* file. 
Then simply click run, which will start the project.

Thanks
